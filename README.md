# Agentic workflows for social zero-sum games

#### "Deductive research approach for modeling and engineering social behavior in zero-sum games, specific to real estate and job market in Berlin"

---

## Research questions

- What is your probability to find a flat / job in Berlin?
- and, which strategy you should use to improve your position?

## Discussion

### Probability calculation:

One way could be by simply calculate demand / supply ratio; \
\*example:

100 applicants for a flat / job, means that you will have a 1% win chance and 99% lose chance.

Assuming that all applicants fullfil all mentioned requirements and assuming a fair game.\

But life is not fair, right :)

It is actually quite difficult to avoid human biases and social preferences in such games.

### proposed ML solution:

To build a model for each landlord / hiring company, which takes social profiles of applicants as input X, and rejection / Acceptance as a label y. and predict your probability of wining in a specific application, based on your social profile, if you meet all requirement(meeting requirements and market conditions could be additional feature as well).

### Strategy learning(tricky part):

people normally learn strategies from:

- googling
- ask friends
- join communities
- Chat GPTs
- etc,..

but usually strategies from those sources tends to be general; not specific to the task and not personalized.

### Proposed solutions:

- a combination of generative llm and ml models (agentic workflow)
- and \ or , a learning agent (reinforced learning)

however, your strategies will affect the chances of the other players. which might require some kind of cooperation / competition strategies in addition (more on that later)

## Methodology / tools:

- ml, llm models
- agent based modeling (in a graph landscape)
- social behavior modeling
- agentic workflows
- maybe, DL or RL models

## Challenges:

- Privacy
- architecture (centralized / decentralized)
- scale / infrastructure
- data
- social engineering (introducing control elements to change social behavior)

## Expected outcomes:

- mainly a draft research paper with some diagrams
- if we have time, a prototype for the gaming engine or at least the interface

## Workflow:

- quick literature review
- brain storming sessions
- writing and diagraming
- models specs
- maybe a front end prototype
